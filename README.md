# EX.-NO-1-E-IMPLEMENTATION-OF-RAIL-FENCE-ROW-COLUMN-TRANSFORMATION-TECHNIQUE

## AIM:
  To write a C program to implement the rail fence transposition technique.
  
## ALGORITHM:

STEP-1: Read the Plain text.

STEP-2: Arrange the plain text in row columnar matrix format.

STEP-3: Now read the keyword depending on the number of columns of the plain text.

STEP-4: Arrange the characters of the keyword in sorted order and the corresponding columns of the plain text.

STEP-5: Read the characters row wise or column wise in the former order to get the cipher text.

## PROGRAM:


## OUTPUT:

## RESULT:
  Thus the rail fence algorithm had been executed successfully.
